# NLP_The-Divine-Comedy
In this Notebook I will try to analize The Divine Comedy by Dante.
The research question we are going to investigate is how the semantic fields evolve during the path of Dante and whether there are significant differences among the three cantiche, or if the poems, even though set in different places, show the same characteristics in terms of contents. This is why, besides a comprehensive analysis of the most important terms in the texts, we will focus on the topic analysis, to reveal differences/analogies in their distribution.

Divine Comedy is a long Italian narrative poem composed of three *cantiche* : Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. 
Inferno is divided into 34 *cantos*, while Purgatorio and Paradiso into 33, each poem is in turn written in tercets. 
For my analysis I have used 3 txt files exported on xlsx, subdiving each text in single verses. English version of the texts, translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, are publicly available on ***gutenberg.org***.

The notebook is organized as follows. Firstly, the data is preprocessed. Secondly, a number of NLP techniques are used to analyze the script of the series. 
The preprocessing process has been carried out for each dataset separately, in order to  perform a more easily analysis on the different poems. Later, the three datasets will be grouped together to allow the comparison between the three texts.
